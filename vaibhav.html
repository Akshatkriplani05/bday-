        <p>Hello Anne ,
            I know we may have not met much in all theese years of friendship but I still remember the first day when you were introduced into the group ,calm and composed but a little of attitude girl I thought ,but you got so much mixed into our group that it just felt like you were also with us from the vedant . You are really such a nice vibe and a nice person.
